# Word count 

Word Counter is the number of words in a document or passage of text. A word counter is a useful tool for writers to see the count of the total number of words in their article.
This Word counter can:
1. Parse texts and show the number of words.
2. The user will enter the text of their article. The number of words in that text will be displayed.
3. Display the number of characters, sentences, paragraphs and top keywords (based on word repetition).
