# Word count 

Word Counter is the number of words in a document or
passage of text. A word counter is a useful tool for writers to see the count of the
total number of words in their article. 

## Some pointers to keep in mind while building a word counter app are:

a. It requires you to build an app that can parse texts and show the number of
words.
b. The user will enter the text of their article. The number of words in that text
should be displayed.
c. Display the number of characters, sentences, paragraphs and top keywords
(based on word repetition).
